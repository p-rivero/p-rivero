Ahoy matey! Happy [International Talk Like a Pirate Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day)!


**Today's tech haiku:**
```
Silent routers hum,  
Governments clash in th' dark,  
Security's breath.  And hoist the mainsail!   
```

## Some o' me projects:

- **[Discord Audio Stream](https://github.com/p-rivero/DiscordAudioStream):** It's very easy t' share yer screen usin' Discord.  Bein' able t' hear it, not so much.  This tool gives ye control o'er th' audio that ye send t' Discord, makin' it possible t' share a screen with audio, use OBS, and any other use case ye can think o'.
 
- **unix.js:** *[Work in progress]* An easy-t'-use framework fer creatin' realistic terminal experiences and ARGs, anywhere JavaScript can run.  It's a UNIX-like fake OS that can be easily extended by addin' new files t' th' filesystem.   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/unix-js) with th' core framework and a parser fer creatin' th' virtual filesystem.   
  - [Base filesystem](https://github.com/p-rivero/unix-js-filesystem) with some core utilities and commands.  Designed t' be used as a template fer user projects.
 - **CESC16:** A custom CPU, designed from scratch and built on PCBs.  Completely 16-bit, with support fer interrupts and improved General Purpose IO (GPIO) ports.   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16) with documentation, schematics and some tools.   
  - [Emulator](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16-emulator) written in C++, usin' th' ncurses library.  Yaaarrrrr!  Shiver me timbers!  
  - [ANSI C compiler](https://github.com/p-rivero/lcc), by implementin' a backend fer th' lcc retargetable compiler.   

- **CESC:** Previous CPU architecture, inspired by Ben Eater's SAP-1 and built on breadboards.  It's an 8-bit architecture with a very simple instruction set.   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESCA) with documentation, images and some tools.
 
- **[Arduino VGA Terminal](https://github.com/p-rivero/ArduinoVGA):** Use an Arduino Nano t' sail a VGA monitor.  It only supports text output, so 'tis great as a terminal fer yer homebrew CPU projects, we'll keel-haul ye!
