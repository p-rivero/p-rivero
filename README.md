<summary><b>About my profile picture ‚ùì</b></summary>
<br>

I had a vague idea of what I wanted, so I asked ChatGPT:
```
I'm trying to use dalle 2 to generate a profile picture.
Could you give me some prompts I could use? I want the profile picture
to be minimalist and geeky or somewhat related to programming.
```
ChatGPT responded with:
```
Here are a few prompts you can use with DALL-E 2 to generate minimalist,
geeky or programming-related profile pictures:

"Minimalistic computer coding symbol"
"Simple geometric shape with a programming language keyword"
"Minimalistic representation of a computer chip"
"A minimalist portrait of a programmer"
"A minimalist representation of a computer keyboard"
"A minimalist representation of a computer mouse"
"A minimalist representation of a computer screen with a code snippet"
"A minimalist representation of a computer network"
"A minimalist representation of a computer server"
Keep in mind that DALL-E 2 is a powerful model but it is not perfect, the results may vary and
it might take multiple attempts to get a good image.
```
Out of all the prompts, `"A minimalist portrait of a programmer"` worked [exceptionally well](https://labs.openai.com/s/wnroTIM2KFrlf4AD2ZqZEiWr), and it even resembles me a bit. With very little editing (mainly to remove a very distracting left eye) I got my current picture.

Other honorable mentions:
- `"A minimalist portrait of a programmer"`: [Picture 1](https://labs.openai.com/s/TsMXREA9KyGmkq6shFyu1GZX), [Picture 2](https://labs.openai.com/s/28sbF5Zl2lykmKrJxl26Ek3N).
- `"Minimalistic representation of a computer chip"`: [A bit too simple, but looks good](https://labs.openai.com/s/YfdwPcA6EXpv4arpExMmSbDR).
- `"A minimalist representation of a computer keyboard"`: [NÃ¥ÕÅÃíÃ©OLÃ∂ÕùÃ¢“âÃõH keyboard layout](https://labs.openai.com/s/nIDzLez4eQF2Q3Q7SEPOLCIu).

## Some of my projects:

- **[Discord Audio Stream](https://github.com/p-rivero/DiscordAudioStream):** It's very easy to share your screen using Discord. Being able to hear it, not so much. This tool gives you control over the audio that you send to Discord, making it possible to share a screen with audio, use OBS, and any other use case you can think of.

- **CESC16:** New and improved CPU architecture, built on PCBs. Completely 16-bit, with support for interrupts and improved General Purpose IO (GPIO) ports.  
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16) with documentation, schematics and some tools.  
  - [Emulator](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16-emulator) written in C++, using the ncurses library.  
  - [ANSI C compiler](https://github.com/p-rivero/lcc), by implementing a backend for the lcc retargetable compiler.  

- **CESC:** Previous CPU architecture, inspired by Ben Eater's SAP-1 and built on breadboards. An 8-bit architecture with a very simple instruction set.  
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESCA) with documentation, images and some tools.

- **[Arduino VGA Terminal](https://github.com/p-rivero/ArduinoVGA):** Use an Arduino Nano to drive a VGA monitor. It only supports text output, so it's great as a terminal for your homebrew CPU projects.
