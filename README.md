<summary><b>About me profile picture ‚ùì</b></summary>
<br>

I had a vague idea o' what I wanted, so I asked ChatGPT:
```
I'm tryin' t' use dalle 2 t' generate a profile picture, by Davy Jones' locker.
 Could ye give me some prompts I could use?  I want th' profile picture
t' be minimalist and geeky or somewhat related t' programmin'.
 And hoist the mainsail!  ```
ChatGPT responded with:
```
Here be a few prompts ye can use with DALL-E 2 t' generate minimalist,
geeky or programmin'-related profile pictures:

"Minimalistic computer codin' symbol"
"Simple geometric shape with a programmin' language keyword"
"Minimalistic representation o' a computer chip"
"A minimalist portrait o' a programmer"
"A minimalist representation o' a computer keyboard"
"A minimalist representation o' a computer mouse"
"A minimalist representation o' a computer screen with a code snippet"
"A minimalist representation o' a computer network"
"A minimalist representation o' a computer server"
Keep in mind that DALL-E 2 be a powerful model but it be not perfect, th' results may vary and
it might take multiple attempts t' get a good image.
 Yaaarrrrr, by Blackbeard's sword!  ```
Out o' all th' prompts, `"A minimalist portrait o' a programmer"` worked [exceptionally well](https://labs.openai.com/s/wnroTIM2KFrlf4AD2ZqZEiWr), and it even resembles me a bit.  With very little editin' (mainly t' remove a very distractin' left eye) I got me current picture.
 
Other honorable mentions:

 - `"Minimalistic representation o' a computer chip"`: [A bit too simple, but looks good](https://labs.openai.com/s/YfdwPcA6EXpv4arpExMmSbDR).

## Some o' me projects:

- **[Discord Audio Stream](https://github.com/p-rivero/DiscordAudioStream):** It's very easy t' share yer screen usin' Discord, and a bottle of rum!  Bein' able t' hear it, not so much.  This tool gives ye control o'er th' audio that ye send t' Discord, makin' it possible t' share a screen with audio, use OBS, and any other use case ye can think o', and a bottle of rum!  And swab the deck! 
- **CESC16:** New and improved CPU architecture, built on PCBs.  Completely 16-bit, with support fer interrupts and improved General Purpose IO (GPIO) ports.   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16) with documentation, schematics and some tools.   
  - [Emulator](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16-emulator) written in C++, usin' th' ncurses library, avast.   
  - [ANSI C compiler](https://github.com/p-rivero/lcc), by implementin' a backend fer th' lcc retargetable compiler, pass the grog!  Walk the plank!  

- **CESC:** Previous CPU architecture, inspired by Ben Eater's SAP-1 and built on breadboards.  An 8-bit architecture with a very simple instruction set, we'll keel-haul ye, to be sure!   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESCA) with documentation, images and some tools.
 
- **[Arduino VGA Terminal](https://github.com/p-rivero/ArduinoVGA):** Use an Arduino Nano t' sail a VGA monitor, ye scurvey dog.  It only supports text output, so 'tis great as a terminal fer yer homebrew CPU projects.  And hoist the mainsail!
