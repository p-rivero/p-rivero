I ❤️ designing and building homebrew CPUs from scratch, inventing my own assembly language and using only discrete logic chips.

## Some of my projects:

**CESC16:** New and improved CPU architecture, built on PCBs. Completely 16-bit, with support for interrupts and improved General Purpose IO (GPIO) ports.
- [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16) with documentation, schematics and some tools.
- [Emulator](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16) written in C++, using the ncurses library.
- [ANSI C compiler](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16), by implementing a backend for the lcc retargetable compiler.

**CESC:** Previous CPU architecture, inspired by Ben Eater's SAP-1 and built on breadboards. An 8-bit architecture with a very simple instruction set.
- [Main repository](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESCA) with documentation, images and some tools.
