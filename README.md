I ❤️ designing and building homebrew CPUs from scratch, inventing my own assembly language and using only discrete logic chips.

## Some of my projects:

**CESC16:** New and improved CPU architecture, built on PCBs. Completely 16-bit, with support for interrupts and improved General Purpose IO (GPIO) ports.
- Main repo with documentation, schematics and some tools.
- Emulator writen in C++, using the ncurses library.
- C compiler
